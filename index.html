                Hello, my name is Jose David Carranza Angarita, I am a 19-year-old young man, born in Pelaya, Cesar,
                Colombia. Since I was a child, I have liked technology and music, so I decided to study Systems
                Engineering at the National Open and Distance University (UNAD) after successfully completing my high
                school studies.
            </p>

            <p>
                Since I was a child, I have always liked topics related to space, astronauts, phones, and computers. I
                was always taking apart everything I found at home to understand how it worked and then trying to put it
                back together. Although it didn't always turn out very well, I always tried.
                <br>
                <br>
                Whenever I got excited about something, I dedicated myself to it completely. I remember once I turned on
                my parents' old recorder that barely made any sound, and by adjusting the volume buttons, it suddenly
                played loudly again but then went back to being quiet. So, I decided to take it apart to see what was
                inside, but in the end, I couldn't put it back together. Every time I tried, it would turn on and then
                turn off by itself. This recorder played cassettes, CDs, and radio, but it never worked again due to my
                curiosity, which ended up breaking it.
            </p>

            <p>
                Every time I took something apart, I ended up making it worse and leaving it non-functional. Since I was
                a child, I had very little access to computers and the internet. When I had my technology and computer
                science classes in school, I liked to arrive early to use the computers and learn how to use them, but I
                was always left wondering how they worked inside.
            <p>
                When I got to university and saw that there was a degree that allowed me to learn to program, to use
                computers, to know how they worked inside, I was very excited and decided to study it. Since then, I
                have learned a lot and improved my skills significantly. Although I still have much to learn, I am very
                happy to have made the decision to study systems engineering.
